                Central Asian and Islamic cuisine. Mughlai cuisine is 
                strongly influenced by the Turkic cuisine of Central Asia,
                the region where the early Mughal emperors originally hailed from,
                and it has in turn strongly influenced the regional cuisines of
                 Northern India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.
