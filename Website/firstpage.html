                <p>
                    Continental food encompasses delicacies found in European countries.
                    Indian and Chinese cuisines are essentially not a part of continental
                    platter rather it consists of French and Mediterranean food.You would
                    find sauces being used as a seasoning in continental food and the
                    cooking techniques would be confined to roasting, frying, and baking.
                    There’s no doubt that people love Continental food. So, let’s explore 
                    some of our favorite delectable Continental delicacies.

                <p>
                    Mughlai cuisine consists of dishes developed in the medieval
                    Indo-Persian cultural centres of the Mughal Empire.
                    It represents a combination of cuisine of the Indian 
                    subcontinent with the cooking styles and recipes of 
                    Central Asian and Islamic cuisine. Mughlai cuisine is 
                    strongly influenced by the Turkic cuisine of Central Asia,
                    the region where the early Mughal emperors originally hailed from,
                    and it has in turn strongly influenced the regional cuisines of
                     Northern India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.
