<h2>Make Yourself feel at home with the hospitable people of Lucknow</h2>
<p>"Lucknow" is the anglicised spelling of the local pronunciation "Lakhnau". 
    According to one legend, the city is named after Lakshmana, a hero of the
    Hindu epic Ramayana. The legend states that Lakshmana had a palace or an 
    estate in the area, which was called Lakshmanapuri (Sanskrit: लक्ष्मणपुरी, lit. 
    Lakshmana's city). The settlement came to be known as Lakhanpur (or Lachhmanpur)
     by the 11th century, and later, Lucknow.
 <br>A similar theory states that the city was known as Lakshmanavati 
 (Sanskrit: लक्ष्मणवती, fortunate) after Lakshmana. The name changed to Lakhanavati, 
 then Lakhnauti and finally Lakhnau. Yet another theory states that the city's 
 name is connected with Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth. Over time, the name 
 changed to Laksmanauti, Laksmnaut, Lakhsnaut, Lakhsnau and, finally, Lakhnau.
 In common with other metropolitan cities across India, Lucknow is multicultural
and multilingual.Many of the cultural traits and customs peculiar to
 Lucknow have become living legends today. The city's contemporary culture is the 
result of the amalgamation of the Hindu and Muslim rulers who ruled the city 
simultaneously. The credit for this goes to the secular and syncretic traditions 
of the Nawabs of Awadh, who took a keen interest in every walk of life and encouraged
these traditions to attain a rare degree of sophistication. Modern day Lucknowites
are known for their polite and polished way of speaking which is noticed by visitors</p>
<p>
Lucknow has had an influence on the Hindi film industry as the birthplace of poet,
dialogue writer and script writer K. P. Saxena, Suresh Chandra Shukla born 10 
February 1954 along with veteran Bollywood and Bengali film actor Pahari Sanyal,
who came from the city's well known Sanyal family.Several movies have
used Lucknow as their backdrop including Shashi Kapoor's Junoon, Muzaffar Ali's
Umrao Jaan and Gaman, Satyajit Ray's Shatranj ke khiladi.<br> Ismail Merchant's 
Shakespeare Wallah, PAA and Shailendra Pandey's JD.In the movie
Gadar: Ek Prem Katha Lucknow was used to depict Pakistan,with locations 
including Lal Pul, the Taj Hotel and the Rumi Darwaza used in Tanu Weds Manu. 
Some parts of Ladies vs Ricky Bahl, Bullett Raja,Ishaqzaade, Ya Rab 
and Dabangg 2 were shot in Lucknow or at other sites nearby.
